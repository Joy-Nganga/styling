    <h2 class="h2">I Am In Need Of Music</h2>
    <p class="p1">
        I am in need of music that would flow <br>
        Over my fretful, feeling fingertips,<br>
        Over my bitter-tainted, trembling lips,<br>
        With melody, deep, clear, and liquid-slow.<br>
        Oh, for the healing swaying, old and low,<br>
        Of some song sung to rest the tired dead,<br>
        A song to fall like water on my head,<br>
        And over quivering limbs, dream flushed to glow!<br>

    </p>
    <p class="p2">
        There is a magic made by melody: <br>
        A spell of rest, and quiet breath, and cool <br>
        Heart, that sinks through fading colors deep <br>
        To the subaqueous stillness of the sea,<br>
        And floats forever in a moon-green pool,<br>
        Held in the arms of rhythm and of sleep.<br>
    </p>
